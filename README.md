## Take a tour of the example application
You build Angular applications with components. Components define areas of responsibility in the UI that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.

A component consists of three things:

## COMPONENT PART	DETAILS
A component class	Handles data and functionality
An HTML template	Determines the UI
Component-specific styles	Define the look and feel
This guide demonstrates building an application with the following components:

### COMPONENTS	DETAILS
| Component | Details |
| ------- | ------- |
|``` <app-root> ``` | The first component to load and the container for the other components |
|```<app-top-bar>```|	The store name and checkout button |
|```<app-product-list>``` |The product list|
|```<app-product-alerts>```	|A component that contains the application's alerts|
